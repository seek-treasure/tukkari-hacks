# Enlarged Feet for Tukkari TS 3D printer enclosure

This repository contains the 3D design files for a modification to the original Tukkari TS printable parts. The enlarged feet design allows the enclosure to hang slightly off the edge of a desk, providing a space-saving solution while maintaining stability.

## Overview

The Tukkari TS Enlarged Feet for Prusa i3 Enclosure modification is designed to improve the original feet by increasing their size and adding a slight overhang feature. This design allows users to better utilize limited desk space while ensuring the enclosure remains stable and secure.

## Printing instructions

Print with the designed orientation. I believe the orientation provided gives the best reliability.

- Solid layers: 5 or more
- Infill: 30%
